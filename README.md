# Confidence Measurement

This is an exploration of methods to calculate the confidence of a data point when one has multiple conflicting data sources
This has been achieved by using the Truth Finder algorithm. Explanation for Truth Finder can be found [here](https://github.com/DataGov-SamagraX/confidence_measurement/blob/main/doc/Introduction.md) 

An exmaple of its application on a sample dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/DataGov-SamagraX/confidence_measurement/blob/main/small_data_algo_exploration/Confidence%20algo%20testing.ipynb)
